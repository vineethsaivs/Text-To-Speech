Tkinter is the Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

gTTS stands for Google-Text-To-Speech
There are several APIs available to convert text to speech in python. One of such APIs is the Google Text to Speech API commonly known as the gTTS API. gTTS is a very easy to use tool which converts the text entered, into audio which can be saved as a mp3 file.

playsound on Python is easy. hese solutions are cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
The main difference is in the ease of use and supported file formats. All of them should work with Python 3. The audio file should be in the same directory as your python program, unless you specify a path.
The playsound module is a cross platform module that can play audio files. This doesnâ€™t have any dependencies, simply install with pip in your virtualenv and run!

Python OS module allows us to use the operating system dependent functionalities and to interact with the underlying operating system in several different ways. For example, we can work with files, change the environment variables, and we can move files around, etc. This is as same as overriding all the os built-in functionalities in a module and using them in a file I/O and system handling.
